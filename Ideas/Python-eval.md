Since you are familiar with PowerShell, Bash, and Python, here are some considerations for each language:

### Python
- **Pros**:
  - Easy to learn and use.
  - Large number of libraries and frameworks.
  - Good support for web development and integration with various APIs.
- **Cons**:
  - Slightly slower execution speed compared to compiled languages.
- **Recommendation**: Python is a versatile language and would be a good choice for building a Contact Sync Service due to its readability and extensive libraries.

### PowerShell
- **Pros**:
  - Excellent for scripting and automation on Windows systems.
  - Integrates well with Microsoft services and APIs.
- **Cons**:
  - Primarily designed for Windows environments.
  - Less common for web application development compared to Python.
- **Recommendation**: If your environment is primarily Windows-based and you are integrating with Microsoft 365, PowerShell could be a strong choice.

### Bash
- **Pros**:
  - Powerful for scripting and automation on Unix/Linux systems.
  - Great for managing and automating server tasks.
- **Cons**:
  - Not ideal for complex application development.
  - Limited in terms of native support for web APIs compared to Python.
- **Recommendation**: Bash is best suited for simple scripts and automation tasks on Unix/Linux systems, but it may not be the best choice for building a full-fledged Contact Sync Service.

### Conclusion
**Python** would make the most sense for building a Contact Sync Service due to its ease of use, readability, and vast ecosystem of libraries. It is well-suited for web development and integrating with APIs, making it a good alternative to Ruby.

### Example: Python Script to Sync Contacts
Here is an example of how you might start a Python script to sync contacts with Microsoft 365:

```python
import requests

class Microsoft365ContactSyncService:
    def __init__(self, access_token):
        self.access_token = access_token
        self.api_base_url = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0"

    def sync_contacts(self, contacts):
        for contact in contacts:
            self.create_or_update_contact(contact)

    def create_or_update_contact(self, contact):
        url = f"{self.api_base_url}/me/contacts"
        headers = {
            "Authorization": f"Bearer {self.access_token}",
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        }
        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=contact)
        if response.status_code == 201:
            print("Contact created successfully")
        else:
            print(f"Error creating contact: {response.status_code} - {response.text}")

# Example usage
access_token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
contacts = [
    {
        "givenName": "John",
        "surname": "Doe",
        "emailAddresses": [{"address": "john.doe@example.com"}],
        "businessPhones": ["+1 555 555 5555"]
    }
]

sync_service = Microsoft365ContactSyncService(access_token)
sync_service.sync_contacts(contacts)
```

This script demonstrates how to authenticate and create contacts in Microsoft 365 using the Microsoft Graph API. You can expand this script to include additional functionalities as needed.
